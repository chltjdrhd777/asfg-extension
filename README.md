<br>
If there is no "asfg.config" folder on the workspace root and when you input the "asfg" command on the command palette, you have the two options.

<br/>

1. _"make exmaple structure"_ : this option create a sample structure.
2. _"make example config"_ : this option create a sample **asfg.config** folder that stores a custom folder structure shape.
